# CHESS Analyzer
Chess board Analyzer demonstrating TDD technique. Uses JUNIT 5 and Hamcrest

The task was to create a chessboard and a queen piece to then evaluate the board and check how many pieces attack any given square. 
Whole process should be done using TDD technique - write a test, create functionality and test it (and refactor if needed)
